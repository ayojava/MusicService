# MusicService

The MusicService is a case study for Scala, Akka and Play.

The "Services" subdirectory contains different implementations of the MusicService.
Currently there is only one implementation written with Play in Scala.

The "Clients" subdirectory contains different implementions of MusicService clients
Currently there is none.

Work is in progress. I'll add more projects depending on the time I can spare to implement
them. No promises. No time lines. This is just a fun job.
