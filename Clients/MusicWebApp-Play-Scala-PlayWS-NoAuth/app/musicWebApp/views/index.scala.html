        <p>
            This simple App is a "Music Web Application", it is
            <ul>
                <li>a web application running in the browser</li>
                <li>with web pages being rendered on the Play server.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The MusicWebApp manages Performers and Recordings. It is a RESTful
            web service client to the web service MusicService.
            The MusicWebApp cannot do any work without MusicService being started.
        </p>

        <p>
            With MusicWebApp the user can perform the following operations in the browser:

            <ul>
                <li>Add, change, delete and query Performers and Recordings</li>
                <li>listen to Recordings</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The App is a small case study using ...

            <ul>
                <li>The Play Framework as containerless Web framework</li>
                <li>Scala as implementation language</li>
                <li>The Play web service library to access the MusicService</li>
                <li>Bootstrap CSS to enhance the look of the web pages</li>
                <li>Currently no client authentication to access performers or recordings</li>
                <li>Currently no client roles with different access priviledges</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            In the current stage the App doesn't implement any security features.
            It offers its interface via HTTP (no HTTPS) and does not require
            the user to log in before accessing recordings on the server.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project build is based on SBT (Scala Build Tool).
