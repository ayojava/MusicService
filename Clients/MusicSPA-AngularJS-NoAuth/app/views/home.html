            <p>
                This simple App is a "Single Page Application (SPA)". It is
                <ul>
                    <li>a web application running in the browser</li>
                    <li>using web frontend technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                    <li>with web pages being rendered in the browser</li>
                    <li>using AngularJS as client-side MVC framework.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The MusicSPA manages music Performers and Recordings. It is a RESTful
                web service client to the web service MusicService.
                The MusicSPA cannot do any work without MusicService being started.
            </p>

            <p>
                With MusicSPA the user can perform the following operations in the browser:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add, change, delete and query Performers and Recordings</li>
                    <li>listen to Recordings</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The App is a small case study using ...
                <ul>
                    <li>AngularJS as client side Web framework</li>
                    <li>JavaScript as implementation language</li>
                    <li>The ngResource library to access the REST API of the MusicService</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap CSS to enhance the look of the web pages</li>
                    <li>Currently no client authentication to access performers or recordings</li>
                    <li>Currently no client roles with different access priviledges</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the current stage the App doesn't implement any security features.
                It communicates with the MusicService via HTTP (no HTTPS) and does not require
                the user to log in before accessing the services data.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project build and management of components is based on <i>npm</i>, <i>bower</i> and <i>gulp</i>.
