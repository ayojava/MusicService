                <p>
                    This  App is a Hybrid Mobile Application. It is<br>
                    - based on web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
                    - using Ionic, AngularJS and Cordova.<br>
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>
                    The MusicApp manages music Performers and Recordings. It is a RESTful
                    web service client to the web service MusicService.
                    The MusicApp cannot do any work without MusicService being started.
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>
                    With MusicApp the user can perform the following operations on a mobile device:<br>
                    - Add, change, delete and query Performers and Recordings<br>
                    - listen to Recordings<br>
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>
                    The App is a small case study using ...<br>
                    - the Ionic framework,<br>
                    - which is based on AngularJS,<br>
                    - Cordova to make the app available for Android and iOS,<br>
                    - the ngResource library to access the REST API of the MusicService<br>
                    - Currently no client authentication to access performers or recordings<br>
                    - Currently no client roles with different access priviledges<br>
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>
                    In the current stage the App doesn't implement any security features.
                    It communicates with the MusicService via HTTP (no HTTPS) and does not require
                    the user to log in before accessing the services data.
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>
                    The project build and management of components is based on <i>ionic</i>, <i>npm</i>, <i>bower</i> and <i>gulp</i>.
                </p>
