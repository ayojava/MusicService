Implementing a many-to-many relationship with Slick
===================================================

After a short introduction to Slick as a reactive interface for relational databases
I will present an example showing the implementation of a many-to-many relationship
with Slick in Scala.

The talk comprises the following sub topics:

- Short Intro to Slick
- Why is it reactive?
- What is FRM (functional relational mapping)?
- Many-to-many table definitions with Slick in Scala
- Ensuring referential integrity
- Adding and deleting relationships
- Using case class mapping for the tables
- Traversing the many-to-many relationship in queries
