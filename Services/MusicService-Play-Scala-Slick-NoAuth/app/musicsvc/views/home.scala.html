<h2>Description of the Music Web Application</h2>

<p>
    This App is a "Music Service", it is
    <ul>
        <li>a web service application providing a data interface with a restful JSON API</li>
        <li>a web application running in the browser</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The Music Service manages Performers and Recordings. Management implies
    CRUD operations on Performers and Recordings, up- and download of music data
    (mp3 files) as well as assigning Performers to Recordings or Recordings to
    Performers and the removal of these assignments.
</p>

<p>
    One entity is a "Performer" with the following attributes:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>name:</strong> the Performer's name</li>
        <li><strong>performerType:</strong> one of "Soloist", "Ensemble", "Conductor"</li>
        <li><strong>recordings:</strong> the Recordings this Performer is performing in</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The other entity is a "Recording" with these attributes:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>title:</strong> the Recording's title</li>
        <li><strong>composer:</strong> the composer of the music contained in the Recording</li>
        <li><strong>year:</strong> the year in which the music has bin recorded</li>
        <li><strong>performers:</strong> the Performers by whom the Recording was performed</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The Music Service allows a client (web service client or web client) to perform the following operations:
    <ul>
        <li>to add, change, delete and query Performers and Recordings</li>
        <li>download or stream music data to the client</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The App is a small case study using ...

    <ul>
        <li>The Play Framework as containerless Web framework</li>
        <li>Scala as implementation language</li>
        <li>Slick as persistence layer</li>
        <li>an H2 database to persist the entities</li>
        <li>Currently no client authentication to access Performers and Recordings</li>
        <li>Currently no client roles with different access priviledges</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    In the current stage the App doesn't implement any security features.
    It offers its interface via HTTP (no HTTPS) and does not require
    the user to log in before accessing recordings on the server.
</p>

<p>
    The project build is based on SBT (Scala Build Tool).
</p>
